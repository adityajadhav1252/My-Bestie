        <h2>💌 A Heartfelt Message</h2>
        <p>Dear Palak, My Forever Person💞<br>
           If I had to name one truth that's never shifted in my life it's you.<br>
           You arrived quietly, like a soft hum in the background, yet your presence has thundered through every corner of me. You've carried the pieces of me I didn't even know were heavy. You didn't fix me you stayed long enough for me to feel whole again & that... that saved me.<br>
           Not through dramatic gestures, but through every moment you believed in me. With every “It's okay,” every shared laugh that stitched my broken edges, you showed me what love looks like in friendship. You saw through the silence. Heard the ache I couldn't name & you answered questions I didn't know I was asking.<br>
           There are people you meet and then there's you. Someone less like a person and more like a quiet miracle. When life felt like too much, you never said “Be Strong.” You simply became the strength I could lean on.<br>
           You are not just a best friend. You are my lifeline. The reason I believe hearts recognize each other before minds catch up. You've held space for my chaos and loved me not in spite of it, but because of it.<br>
           If the world ever pulls us apart, know this, my soul will always stretch back toward yours because home isn't a place it's you.<br>
           You're stitched into my prayers, my story, my becoming & if tears roll down your cheeks while reading this… let them because you deserve every bit of this truth.<br>
           I would trade a hundred bright days just to be by your side on the darkest one. That's how much you mean to me.<br>
           I love you beyond explanation, beyond distance, beyond time.<br>
           Always your person💫</p>

        <h2>📝 Open Letter</h2>
        <p>I never imagined writing to you like this with my heart laid bare and my voice trembling between every word. But sometimes silence weighs heavier than truth and I'd rather speak imperfectly than say nothing at all.<br>
           You were never just a friend. You were the chapter I never saw coming the highlight reel in a world that often feels muted. You turned everyday moments into memories I now hold like fragile glass. I see your laugh in places you're no longer in and it breaks me a little every time.<br>
           Friendship, real friendship, doesn't just happen. It grows in the quiet gestures in the way you always knew when I needed someone before I said a word. It lives in those 2 AM conversations, in the comfort of shared silence, and in the feeling that somehow, somewhere, someone truly gets you. You were that person for me.<br>
           That's why the space between us hurts so deeply. It's not just about the incident it's about the slow fading of something beautiful & I keep asking myself, Did I fail you? Did I forget to choose kindness when it mattered most?<br>
           I've spent nights rewriting what I should've said, what I should've done differently. Not because I want to change the past but because you matter in a way that the world rarely allows us to feel. Because if I could go back and undo the hurt, I would without hesitation, without pride.<br>
           This isn't an apology wrapped in guilt. It's a love letter to the friendship we built. To the version of us that felt unshakable & if you ever feel the echo of that bond in your own heart please know, I do too. I always will.<br>
           So here I am hopeful, aching, honest. Telling you that our friendship has been one of the most real, soul-deep connections I've ever known & if there's still a thread left between us, I'll hold onto it gently, never letting it fray again.</p>

        <h2>🎢 Shayari of Us</h2>
        <p style="white-space: pre-line; font-style: italic; font-size: 1.1rem;">
        Kabhi dosti thi jaise paragliding ki oonchai,  
        Jahan tere saath udte the khuli aasmaan ki rangai.  
        Phir aaya gussa jaise river rafting ki dhaar,  
        Baha le gaya sab kuch, chhod gaya ek sawaal baar-baar.  
      
        Tu zorbing ball mein gum ho gayi hai kahin,  
        Dekha toh hai paas, par mehsoos nahi wahi.  
        Hum toh bas ek hot air balloon ki tarah hain ab,  
        Upar se muskaan, andar se khaali-pan sab.  
      
        Agar fir se shuru ho sake yeh parasailing k safar,  
        Toh main thaam loon tera haath, chahe ho jitna bhi darr.</p>
