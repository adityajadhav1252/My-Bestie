# My-Bestie
A deeply personal digital letter to Palak, my best friend, my safe space, my once in a lifetime person. This site captures the soul of our friendship through memories, messages, music, promises, and unspoken emotions. Built not just with code, but with love, hope, and a quiet wish for healing.
